# Our Mission

## We foster wellness, creativity and sustainability.

We support sustainability by honoring Nature’s ecosystems through educational campaigns, land stewardship opportunities, conservation practices, habitat enhancement and pollinator friendly gardens.

We cultivate creativity through community arts and cultural events, provide artist residencies, performance opportunities and art-based programs.

We connect and empower communities and individuals to wellness through equitable educational programs that include yoga, meditation, mindfulness, spirituality, creative arts, volunteering and passive recreation.

# Our Vision

## A world in which humans live in harmony with Nature.
Harmony is a reciprocal state of balance that nurtures joyful acceptance and recognizes the essential interconnection among all.

## Empowered People, Empower People

# Our Values

## Educational Center for the Human Spirit

Our programming philosophy is based on the concept that there is no “one size fits all approach to wellness or learning.” Following in the footsteps of the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu, in adhering to the simple concept that, “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach him how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime”. We empower individuals by ensuring education is the principal thread within all that we weave.

We beleive in multi-generational experiences and providing safe and inclusive spaces for learning.
