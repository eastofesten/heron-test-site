## Donor Advised Fund 

Gifts from Donor Advised Funds (DAF) are welcomed and accepted at the The Heron Center.
If you have a DAF you can direct a grant from your sponsoring donor organization be sent to:
Philosophy of the Eight Guided Paths Spiritual Guidance Center
179 Legacy Lane, Westport, MA 02790
When you make a donor advised fund gift, it’s possible that the sponsoring organization will not share your information with us. Please send us a note to Jessica Howard, Executive Director, at theheroncenter@gmail.com when you’ve made a gift so we can make sure to thank you and ensure your gift gets to where it is intended.


## Matching Gifts
Many employers, whether you are currently employed or retired, offer to match donations that you make personally to your favorite charities. Simply ask your employer if this is an option at your workplace, and if so, they will provide you with instructions and a matching gift form. It’s a great way to double your gift, and help The Heron Center take actions towards sustainability, wellness and creativity in our community and for our world.

## Planned Giving


Leave a legacy that transcends time!
There are many ways to support that work for people of all means, and at all stages of life.
Read on to learn more about the options that are available.
Include us in your will or trust

The simplest and most common way to include The Philosophy of the Eight Guided Paths Spiritual Guidance Center Charitable Trust (D.B.A. The Heron Center) in estate planning is by making a charitable provision in your will or trust. This kind of charitable bequest can be a designated dollar amount, a percentage of your estate, or the residual amount remaining in your estate after all other obligations have been made.

You and your attorney may use this sample language:

“I herby give and bequeath ______ (dollar amount, or percentage, of residual of the estate) to the The Philosophy of the Eight Guided Paths Spiritual Guidance Center Charitable Trust, 311 Sanford Rd, Westport MA 02790, for its general purposes.”
Donate all or part of your retirement funds

Retirement funds in many ways are the perfect asset to leave to charity, because – unlike your heirs – charitable beneficiaries do not have to pay any income taxes for receiving those funds. It is also quick and easy: You simply need to notify the custodian of your retirement funds that you want all or part of a particular fund to pass to The Philosophy of the Eight Guided Paths Spiritual Guidance Center Charitable Trust.
Donate the principal of your donor-advised fund

If you have a donor-advised fund (DAF), you might consider directing the organization sponsoring your DAF that you would like the principal of your fund donated at the end of your life to The Philosophy of the Eight Guided Paths Spiritual Guidance Center Charitable Trust and other charitable organizations you care about at set percentages.
Name us as a beneficiary on your financial accounts

Naming The Philosophy of the Eight Guided Paths Spiritual Guidance Center Charitable Trust as a beneficiary on your financial accounts—such as retirement plans, bank accounts, and life insurance policies— costs nothing and doesn’t require a will or lawyer.

You add us as a beneficiary the same way you would add a loved one—or you can add us in addition to loved ones. All you need to do is contact your account provider and request a “Change of Beneficiary” form (you might find this on the provider’s website).

Please notify us if you’ve included us in your estate plans so we can welcome you to The Heron Giving Circle , which recognizes and celebrates you in many ways throughout the year. The generosity of people like you ensures that land conservation, conscientious earth stewardship, creative arts and health will thrive in the beautiful SouthCoast and continue for years to come.
