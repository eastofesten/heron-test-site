Explorations of Loss, Resilience & Hope 
This program uses yoga, somatic, and creative expression movement techniques to bring awareness to the stages of grief. We will use music, movement and journaling as a way to empower each person in developing sensate and emotional awareness of their body and mind. This program offers a safe space to tell and share stories of loss and hope. 
Offered as a special educational workshop or by request. Contact us
