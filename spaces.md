# Wildlife Sanctuary

Since 2012 the Squillante Family Trust has bequeathed our mission with 22 acres in Westport MA. The land we work with is part of a magical Riparian Biome. Riparian biomes are essential ecosystems that support clean air, water and protection from erosion and flooding. We have partnered with N.R.C.S. to implement a Forest Management Plan to enhance ecology, augment conservation practices, and support our pollinators.

# The Studio


## The Studio is home to diverse educational programs, classes and events that support our mission.

Located on the first floor of the Historic Durfee Mills, our studio atmosphere is bright, spacious and welcoming. We first opened our doors in October of 2011 and feel blessed to remain part of the SouthCoast Community.

### Whatâ€™s inside?

We have a lounge area and library loan, a puppet studio, multi-purpose sprung floors for safe and sustainable movement practices, smaller adjoining rooms and an area dedicated to local artists.
