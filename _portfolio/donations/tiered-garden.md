From 2013-2014 over thirty volunteers helped us to build the Tiered Garden and Yurt.  These unique features in our landscape mosaic provide beautiful spaces for people to gather and connect with Nature. The Tiered Garden implements pesticide and chemical free practices and companion planting and permaculture methods for a pollinator friendly habitat. The Yurt is a round building set amidst Oak Trees and hosts many educational programs in addition to offering members a tranquil space for meditation and nature observation.
